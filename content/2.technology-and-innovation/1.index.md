## Appliction Integration Team
DevOps remote access into the BILH system Health Connect productions:
https://hciedev.laheyhealth.org/devops

From there are all the relevant links to each Management Portal, Dashboards, and Documentation.

### Cockpit Navigator for Files
- Live – https://hcieprd.laheyhealth.org/files/navigator
- Test – https://hcietst.laheyhealth.org/files/navigator
- Development – https://hciedev.laheyhealth.org/files/navigator

### InterSystems ObjectScript
Caché Studio IDE that uses direct access into the platform SuperServer port is deprecated. Their Atelier API web service for developers was ported from Eclipse as a plug-in extension pack for Microsoft VS Code:
- https://intersystems-community.github.io/vscode-objectscript

### Interoperability
DevOps is performed chiefly within these menu items on the Management Portal, such as:
- Switching between IRIS Namespaces that run a production
- Maintaining a Business Partner directory to identify their interfaces
- Credential management for business host adapters that use them
- Data Lookup Tables for local dictionary use in data transformations
- Developing Business Processes and Rules for message routers
- Defining record maps, both flat and complex
- Manage messages
- View alerts and logs
- Production monitoring

### Task Manager
Other scheduled tasks can be constructed here outside a production, including but not limited to:
- Standard instance journal purge
- Standard production message & activity purges
- Production code and data dictionaries exporting with files archive rotation and retention
- Daily update for the instance Port Authority Report stored & viewed out of HSCUSTOM

### Files
Logical links /files and /hs point to their respective dev-test-live filesystem designated for external production files. Both are provided to maintain logical consistency for BIDMC and Lahey current state withinterfaces.
