Our [EDI DevOps](https://www.intersystems.com/lp/healthcare-interoperability-solutions/ "InterSystems Health Connect") spans multiple analysts, developers, and consultants with support from their [Technical PM](https://robert.hurst-ri.us/rob/artifacts), me. I am thinking it better to consolidate our KB/HOWTO, dashboards, monitors, reporting and tools into one portal. And for the past 8 years, I have been advocating the use of `VS Code` as a replacement over the proprietary `Studio` IDE. It is apparent with the `2024` release that now is a good time to do that.

In steps [Code Server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server) to mitigate and provide a centralized solution to resolve its complexity for having to disparately install on a variety of remote endpoints. Also, there are numerous activities needed to work off the host CLI, so providing a number of self "helpers" to [Xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) consoles is beneficial toward the team's overall technical maturity.

As a final objective, I would like to promote the team's activities off the home page, suitable for guest browsing too, that can provide the latest news and events out of this space. Some may be generated programmatically while others could be a post by the team (moderated by its admins).

### What is ObjectScript?

ObjectScript is a programming language used to develop and implement applications on the MUMPS (Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System) platform, which is a popular healthcare information system used in hospitals and healthcare organizations.

ObjectScript is a general-purpose, object-oriented language that allows developers to create custom applications, interfaces, and tools for MUMPS. It's designed to be a flexible and efficient language for building complex applications, including clinical decision support systems, patient management systems, and other healthcare-related software.

ObjectScript is used to create a wide range of applications, including:

1. Clinical decision support systems
2. Patient management systems
3. Laboratory information systems
4. Radiology information systems
5. Pharmacy management systems
6. Telemedicine systems
7. Electronic health records (EHRs)

ObjectScript is known for its:

1. **Object-oriented programming**: It supports object-oriented programming concepts, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which make it easier to write reusable and maintainable code.
2. **Dynamic typing**: ObjectScript is dynamically typed, which means that the data type of a variable is determined at runtime, rather than at compile time.
3. **Extensive libraries and frameworks**: MUMPS provides a vast library of built-in functions and frameworks that make it easy to perform common tasks, such as data manipulation, networking, and security.
4. **Integration with MUMPS**: ObjectScript is tightly integrated with the MUMPS platform, allowing developers to leverage the strengths of both languages.

Overall, ObjectScript is a powerful and flexible language that enables developers to create complex, customized applications for the healthcare industry.

### What does EDI in healthcare IT mean?

In healthcare IT, EDI stands for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). It refers to the electronic exchange of business documents and data between different healthcare organizations, such as hospitals, clinics, insurance companies, and pharmacies, in a standardized and secure manner.

1. **Patient information**: Demographic data, medical history, allergies, and treatment plans.
2. **Lab results**: Test results, medication lists, and other clinical data.
3. **Prescriptions**: Medication orders, refill requests, and medication allergy information.
4. **Claims and billing**: Insurance claims, billing information, and payment processing.
5. **Referrals and authorizations**: Referral requests, authorization requests, and prior authorization information.

EDI in healthcare IT aims to:

1. **Improve data accuracy**: Reduce errors and inconsistencies in data exchange.
2. **Enhance patient care**: Enable healthcare providers to access patient information quickly and easily.
3. **Streamline administrative tasks**: Automate routine tasks, such as claims processing and billing.
4. **Increase efficiency**: Reduce manual data entry and processing time.
5. **Improve patient engagement**: Enable patients to access their medical records and communicate with their healthcare providers more easily.

EDI in healthcare IT can be achieved through various methods, including:

1. **AS2 (Application-Specific Integration Profiles)**: A standardized protocol for secure, reliable, and efficient data exchange.
2. **HL7 (Health Level Seven)**: A standard for exchanging clinical and administrative data between healthcare systems.
3. **X12 (Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transportation)**: A standard for exchanging business documents, such as claims and billing information.

By implementing EDI in healthcare IT, organizations can improve the efficiency, accuracy, and quality of patient care, while reducing costs and improving patient satisfaction.

### Why is HL7 data important and how long has it been used?

HL7 (Health Level Seven) is a standard for exchanging clinical and administrative data between healthcare organizations, and it has been widely adopted in the healthcare industry for over three decades. Here's why HL7 data is important and its history:

**Why is HL7 data important?**

1. **Standardization**: HL7 provides a standardized way to exchange data between different healthcare systems, ensuring that data is consistent and accurate.
2. **Interoperability**: HL7 enables healthcare organizations to share data with each other, facilitating collaboration and improving patient care.
3. **Improved data quality**: HL7 helps to reduce errors and inconsistencies in data exchange, ensuring that data is accurate and reliable.
4. **Enhanced care coordination**: HL7 enables healthcare providers to access patient data from multiple sources, improving care coordination and reducing duplication of efforts.
5. **Regulatory compliance**: HL7 helps healthcare organizations comply with regulatory requirements, such as HIPAA, by ensuring the secure exchange of protected health information (PHI).

**History of HL7**

HL7 was first developed in 1987 by a group of healthcare professionals, including Dr. John D. McDermott, who recognized the need for a standardized way to exchange clinical data between healthcare systems. The first version of HL7, version 1.0, was released in 1987.

Over the years, HL7 has undergone several revisions, with new versions and extensions being released regularly. Some notable milestones include:

1. **HL7 Version 2.0 (1995)**: Introduced the concept of a standardized message structure and vocabulary.
2. **HL7 Version 2.3 (1999)**: Added support for clinical decision support and clinical decision-making.
3. **HL7 Version 2.4 (2003)**: Introduced the concept of a standardized data model and vocabulary.
4. **HL7 Version 3.0 (2007)**: Introduced a new data model and vocabulary, as well as support for clinical decision support and population health management.
5. **HL7 Version 3.1 (2011)**: Introduced support for electronic health records (EHRs) and electronic health information exchange (HIE).
6. **HL7 Version 3.2 (2016)**: Introduced support for advanced analytics and data visualization.

Today, HL7 is widely used in the healthcare industry, with over 90% of healthcare organizations using HL7 to exchange data. Its adoption has been driven by the need for improved interoperability, data quality, and care coordination.

HL7 has also been adopted by various industries beyond healthcare, including:

1. **Pharmaceuticals**: HL7 is used to exchange data between pharmaceutical companies, regulatory agencies, and healthcare providers.
2. **Medical devices**: HL7 is used to exchange data between medical device manufacturers, healthcare providers, and regulatory agencies.
3. **Insurance**: HL7 is used to exchange data between insurance companies, healthcare providers, and regulatory agencies.

In summary, HL7 has been a crucial standard for healthcare data exchange for over three decades, enabling improved interoperability, data quality, and care coordination. Its continued adoption and evolution have made it an essential tool for the healthcare industry.
